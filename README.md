# Summary

This is a list of resources - books, MOOCs, youtube videos, etc that I have personally gone through(atleast some of it) and feel could be helpful to a person. These also include paid courses/resources. The resources are not listed in any specific order.

Do note, this won't make you a computer scientist or an engineer and is instead meant to be complementary to your formal education.

# Misconceptions

#### Do I need to learn to use Linux?
I have heard a lot of people say that one should familiarise themselves with Linux based operating systems. I strongly disagree. You might actually be better off with a Macbook (I would have bought the Macbook Pro if it had an Nvidia GPU).You are also perfectly okay using Windows - it is just harder to get things working there.
