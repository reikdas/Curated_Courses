# Summary

This is a list of resources - books, MOOCs, youtube videos, etc that me - reikdas have personally gone through(atleast some of it) and feel could be helpful to a person. These also include paid courses/resources.

Instead of sending me messages asking for suggestions on what you should do to improve as a computer programmer, please go through these. (Yes students of IEM I am looking at you)
Do note, this won't make you a computer scientist or an engineer or even close to either of those and is in no way a replacement for your college education. You can consider this as something you should go through when you have free time.

# Misconceptions

I have heard a lot of people say that one should familiarise themselves with Linux based operating systems. I strongly disagree. You might actually be better off with a Macbook (I would have bought the Macbook Pro if it had an Nvidia GPU).You are also perfectly okay using Windows - it is just harder to get things working there.
